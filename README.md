# What's SpeedStars?
Speed Stars is a unique, high-intensity running game inspired by real-world track competitions, where the goal is brutally simple: beat the racer beside you and cross the finish line first.

Create your athlete, step onto the track, and compete in sprints and relays as you chase personal bests, world records, and leaderboard dominance. Victory isn’t about button-mashing — it’s about rhythm, precision, and control.

The core mechanic is rhythm-driven sprinting. You alternate left and right inputs with a tight, even cadence, timing each press or tap to control every stride. Hold too long and your runner stumbles forward, loses speed, and watches victory slip away. Clean, perfectly timed inputs let you explode down the track.

Every fraction of a second matters. Small mistakes cost medals, but mastering the rhythm transforms you into an elite sprinter. Speed Stars rewards focus, consistency, and flawless execution — just like real track racing.
